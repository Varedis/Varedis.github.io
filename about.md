Developmentr was set up by me, Rob Scott, as an effort to bring high quality and informative tutorials to the development community. 

I have worked professionally in various forms of development for over 14 years. During that time I have worked with some household names in both the UK and USA using various technologies to fulfill the needs of the business.
