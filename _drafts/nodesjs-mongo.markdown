# Summary

In this tutorial we will be looking at integrating MongoDB into our application. And getting our Node.js code to insert and retrieve data from it.

# Introduction

Welcome to Part 2 of our **Learn Node.js in 30 minutes or less** series. In this 30 minute section we will look at integrating another piece of the **MEAN** stack into our application.

In Part 1 of this tutorial we already got two pieces of the **MEAN** stack working together (**E**xpress and **N**ode), today we will be focusing on **M**ongoDB.

**MongoDB** is an open source and highly scalable document based database. It stores the data in documents that are JSON formatted, so makes it perfect for working with javascript. It is also, blazingly fast.

We will be creating a database to store our user information and then creating routes in our Node.js application to insert and retrieve that data.

# Source Code

We will be working from where we left off in [Part 1](http://developmentr.com/nodejs/2015/01/30/learn-nodejs.html), so you can use the code you already have, or you can grab a fresh copy from [here](LINK_HERE){:target="_blank"}.
